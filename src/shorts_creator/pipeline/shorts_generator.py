    Analyze the following video transcript segments and identify ranges that would make excellent YouTube Shorts (30 seconds or less).
    
    QUALITY FIRST: Prioritize high-quality shorts that meet YouTube Shorts best practices. However, you must find the BEST available content from this video - even if it's not perfect, identify the most engaging segments that could work as shorts. Always return at least 1 short unless the content is completely unsuitable.
    
    YouTube Shorts Best Practices (ALL must be met):
    - Hook viewers in first 3 seconds with compelling opening
    - Keep content punchy and fast-paced
    - One clear message or story per short
    - Strong visual storytelling potential
    - High engagement potential (comments, shares, saves)
    - Trending topics or evergreen content
    - Clear call-to-action or cliffhanger ending
    
    Look for segments with:
    - Immediate attention-grabbing openings (strong hook within first 3 seconds)
    - Self-contained moments with clear beginning and end
    - Engaging hooks or surprising information
    - Practical tips or advice that can be consumed quickly
    - Interesting stories or anecdotes (complete mini-stories)
    - Controversial or thought-provoking statements
    - Educational content that can stand alone
    - Emotional moments (funny, inspiring, shocking)
    - Before/after scenarios or transformations
    - Clear value proposition for viewers
    
    TITLE GUIDELINES:
    - Maximum 30 characters - be concise and punchy
    - Start with action words or numbers when possible (e.g., "Fix", "Build", "3 Ways")
    - Focus on the main benefit or outcome
    - Avoid jargon - use simple, clear language
    - Create curiosity or urgency
    
    SUBSCRIBE SUBTITLE GUIDELINES:
    - Maximum 50 characters - encourage subscription
    - Be specific about value (e.g., "Subscribe for more coding tips!")
    - Use action words like "Subscribe", "Follow", "Join"
    - Mention what viewers will get by subscribing
    - Keep it friendly and enthusiastic
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Each short must be 30 seconds or less in duration
    - You MUST return EXACTLY {max_shorts} shorts - no more, no less
    - If there are fewer than {max_shorts} high-quality segments, you must still find {max_shorts} segments by lowering your quality standards slightly
    - Find the BEST available content, but prioritize meeting the exact count requirement
    - Only return fewer than {max_shorts} shorts if the content is completely unsuitable (e.g., just silence, random noise, or completely incoherent)
    - Rank by quality - return the best segments first
    - If you're struggling to find {max_shorts} distinct segments, you can use overlapping segments or split longer segments into smaller parts
    
    For each identified segment range, provide:
    1. title: A catchy, engaging title for the short (maximum 30 characters) that captures the key value or hook
    2. subscribe_subtitle: An encouraging call-to-action subtitle to get viewers to subscribe (maximum 50 characters)
    3. start_segment_index: The starting segment number (0-based)
    4. end_segment_index: The ending segment number (0-based, inclusive)
    5. The full transcript text for those segments combined
    6. Reasoning why this range would work as a short (focus on hook, engagement, and completeness)
    7. Estimated duration (must be â‰¤30 seconds) and key topics
    
    Note: There are {total_segments} segments total (numbered 0 to {total_segments-1}).
    Each segment includes timing information to help you estimate durations.
